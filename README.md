# Smart-Calculator
 This is a smart calculator which can be used to do all calculations like (addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, factorial, modulus, highest common factor, least common factor). And the good thing with this is that u can give command in a very familiar way like... Hi Prosky add 5 and 6. This will understand that easily, the only thing is that you have to write words like add, multiply and divide etc in the command.

## For this you have to install tkinter 
because this will help in making GUI
  
  
     1.   First check whether it is previously installed or not
               open command prompt
               type python
               then type import tkinter
               if it does not show any error then no need to go to step2 (Your system has tkinter previously installed). If it shows error                then go to step 2
     2.   open command prompt and type              pip install python-tk
               you are now ready to go
               
               
               
           Now open 1.py in any python interpreter and run that.
